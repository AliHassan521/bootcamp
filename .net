Assignment 06

.NET Core Web API Assignment
1. Overview & Objectives
In this extension assignment, you will transform the console-based Patient Visit Manager into a full-fledged .NET Core Web API application with HTML front-end pages. You will implement:

User registration and login with role-based access
All core flows from the console app exposed as RESTful endpoints
Repository Pattern, Dependency Injection, SOLID principles, and design patterns
ADO.NET  for database communication using the previously designed schema
HTML/CSS pages to interact with your Web API
By completing this assignment, you will gain hands-on experience building a layered, maintainable web application using modern .NET practices.

2. Assignment Requirements
Part 1: Architecture & Design
Identify and document all API endpoints required to support:
Patient CRUD operations
Doctor CRUD operations
Visit scheduling and querying
Fee schedule retrieval
Activity log retrieval
User registration, login, and role management
Design Controller classes mapping each endpoint to action methods.
Define domain models and DTOs for request and response payloads.
Create repository interfaces and implementations for each aggregate using the Repository Pattern.
Outline dependency injection configuration for services and repositories.
Apply SOLID principles and use at least one design pattern (e.g., Factory, Strategy, Adapter) where appropriate.
Part 2: Implementation
Initialize a .NET Core Web API project (use the latest LTS version).
Configure ADO.NET  data access:
Connection string in appsettings.json
DbConnection and DbCommand usage in repositories
Implement each repository method for CRUD operations and custom queries.
Build Controllers with appropriate HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.
Implement authentication:
Secure endpoints with JWT or cookie-based auth
Enforce role-based authorization (e.g., Admin vs. User)
Develop HTML/CSS pages:
Login and registration forms
Views for listing and managing Patients, Doctors, Visits
Navigation menu and basic styling
Part 3: Testing & Documentation
Provide a Postman collection (or equivalent) demonstrating all API calls and authentication flow. Don’t know what postman is? Don’t worry you can learn about it from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A36VQFdIAkI 
Write a README with:
Setup instructions (database creation, running migrations)
How to launch the Web API and HTML front-end
Description of design patterns used and DI setup
3. File & Branch Organization
Git Branch: project-01-webapi
Solution Structure:
Controllers/
Models/ (Domain + DTO)
Repositories/Interfaces and Implementations
Services/ (business logic if separated)
Data/ (ADO.NET  setup)
wwwroot/ (HTML, CSS files)
Include comments at the top of each file with your name and date.
4. Step-by-Step Guidelines
Plan your API surface by mapping console app commands to REST endpoints.
Scaffold the Web API project and configure DI in Startup/Program.
Implement ADO.NET  repositories and test data access methods.
Build Controllers.
Create HTML views and AJAX calls or form posts to your API.
Test all flows with Postman and through the UI pages.
Document your setup and design decisions in the README.
5. Submission Guidelines
Deadline: Friday, August 15th (deliver when you reach the office before 11:00 AM)

Extension Tasks
1. Authentication and Authorization
Add persistence for users and roles (tables or reuse existing) with unique email constraint.
Store passwords as hashed + salted values (no plaintext).
Implement endpoint POST /api/auth/register to create a user.
Implement endpoint POST /api/auth/login to return a JWT access token containing user role/claims.
Implement endpoint POST /api/auth/change-password for authenticated users.
Enforce token expiry and deny access with expired/invalid tokens.
Define roles: at minimum Admin, Doctor, Receptionist.
Create authorization policies (e.g., RequireAdmin, RequireDoctorOrAdmin, RequireReceptionistOrAdmin).
Protect endpoints using [Authorize] + policies
Return 401 for unauthenticated and 403 for unauthorized requests.
2. Middlewares
Implement Exception Handling Middleware that returns JSON ProblemDetails (type, title, status, traceId, optional detail).
Implement Request Logging + Timing Middleware that records method, path, user (if any), status code, and elapsed ms.
3. Validation (FluentValidation) & Filters:
Add FluentValidation validators for DTOs used by your endpoints
Create a Validation Filter that returns 400 with a unified error payload when validation fails.
4. Logging:
Use Serilog to log error response that are being caught by your exception handling middleware and your general logs on a text file.
NOTE: Deadline of this assignment is Monday 18th of August, 2025 (Before 10.30 am)

Deliverables:
Code on Git branch
Postman collection JSON
README and Front-End files included in wwwroot
Ensure your solution runs without errors and UI pages can perform all operations.
