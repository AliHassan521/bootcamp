“From classroom code to real-world challenges — the last 30 days have been a whirlwind! 🚀”
I’m excited to share that I’ve completed my first month as a Full Stack Web Developer Intern at CureMD!

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been diving deep into .NET and Angular, expanding my skills and learning how to build scalable, real-world applications. The experience so far has been both challenging and rewarding, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to grow in such a dynamic environment.

Big thanks to the amazing team at CureMD for the support and guidance. Looking forward to what the coming months bring! 🙌
