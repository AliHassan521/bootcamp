Assignment: Contact Card Dashboard
Overview
Build a two-panel Contact Card Dashboard to practice Angular @Input, @Output, event/property binding, and lifecycle hooks—without any typed inputs.

Layout
Left Panel (Listing)
A row of filter buttons: All, Favourites, Family, Friends, Classmates.
A contact list showing cards for the currently active filter.
Right Panel (Details)
Shows the selected contact’s full details.
Data & Mock Content
Create 50 mock contacts.
Each contact must include:
id, name, phone, email, gender, address
groups: string[] where a contact can be in multiple groups (any of: Favourites, Family, Friends, Classmates).
Behaviour
Clicking a filter button updates the left list to show only contacts in that group
(use All to show everything).
Clicking a contact in the left list selects it and displays its details in the right panel.
The right panel must include group toggle buttons for:
Mark as Favourite / Unfavourite
Add/Remove from Family
Add/Remove from Friends
Add/Remove from Classmates
State changes are immediate:
If a contact is marked as Favourite, it must instantly appear when the Favourites filter is active.
The same applies when adding/removing the contact from Family, Friends, or Classmates while those filters are active.
Technical Requirements
No text inputs or forms—only buttons/toggles and click events.
State up, data down:
The parent component owns the source of truth: contacts list, selected contact, and current filter.
Children receive data via @Input and communicate changes via @Output.
Use event binding for clicks and property binding for visual states (e.g., active filter button, favourite badge).
Demonstrate lifecycle hooks
Acceptance Criteria
Left panel shows filter buttons and a list that updates correctly for All/Favourites/Family/Friends/Classmates.
50 contacts are present with a spread across groups; several contacts belong to multiple groups.
Clicking a contact displays full details (name, phone, email, gender, address, group badges) in the right panel.
Toggling Favourite/Family/Friends/Classmates on the details view immediately updates:
the contact’s state,
the current filtered list.
No text boxes—only buttons and click actions.
Extension: Contact Card Dashboard (Routing, Add Contact, Search).
Goals
Extend your existing Contact Card Dashboard to use Angular routing, Reactive Forms, and a type-restricted search with a highlight pipe and a custom input directive.

New Features (on top of your current dashboard)
Routing
Add a route to open the dashboard: /dashboard.
Add a second route to open an “Add Contact” page: /contacts/new.
Add Contact Page
Build a separate page (component) at /contacts/new.
Use Reactive Forms (no template-driven forms) with suitable fields to capture the full contact model:
id, name, phone, email, gender, address, groups: string[] (from: Favourites, Family, Friends, Classmates).
On clicking Add, persist the new contact into the app’s state and route back to /dashboard.
The newly added contact should immediately appear in the All list and in any relevant group filters.
Search on Dashboard
Add a search input above the left-panel listing on /dashboard.
Behavior: exact match on name only (case-insensitive).
As the user types, display only contacts whose name equals the typed text exactly (ignoring case).
No partial/contains search for filtering (strict equality).
Create and use a pipe to highlight the matched portion of the name (the entire name will be highlighted when it exactly matches).
Input Restriction Directive
Create a reusable attribute directive that only allows letters A–Z / a–z and space to be entered.
Apply this directive to the dashboard search field.
The directive must gracefully allow control keys (Backspace, Delete, Arrow keys, Tab, etc.).
Architecture & Constraints
Keep “state up, data down”:
The parent (dashboard container) remains the single source of truth for: contacts list, selected contact, and current filter.
Children get data via @Input() and emit changes via @Output().
Immediate state updates:
Adding a contact updates the dashboard lists instantly.
Existing group toggles (Favourite/Family/Friends/Classmates) must continue to update the active filtered list immediately.
Lifecycle hooks: Continue to demonstrate where appropriate (e.g., init, changes).
No changes to existing group filter buttons/behavior from the base assignment, other than coexisting with the new search bar.
Forms are now allowed (Reactive Forms only) for the Add Contact page and the search field on the dashboard.
Acceptance Criteria
/dashboard shows:
Filter buttons (All/Favourites/Family/Friends/Classmates) working as before.
A search field above the list that:
Accepts only letters and spaces (via your directive).
Filters by exact, case-insensitive match on name.
Uses the highlight pipe to emphasize the matched name.
/contacts/new shows a Reactive Form for all contact fields (including selecting groups).
Clicking Add saves the contact and navigates back to /dashboard.
The new contact appears immediately in All and in any chosen group filter.
Existing behavior remains:
Clicking a contact shows details on the right panel.
Toggling group membership in the details view updates the contact and the current filtered list immediately.
No template-driven forms.
What to Submit
Source code (Angular app) with:
Routes configured for /dashboard and /contacts/new.
Add Contact component using Reactive Forms.
Search input with the custom alpha-space directive applied.
Highlight pipe used in the list UI.
Clear @Input()/@Output() usage and lifecycle hook demos where applicable.
